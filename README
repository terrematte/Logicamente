To install the LOGICAMENTE you must copy the directory /logicamente to:

# /var/www/moodle/mod/

With permissions of reading and writting to the directory:

# chmod -R 755 /var/www/moodle/mod/logicamente/

Now you must logon in the MOODLE with a Administrator account and create a new Recourse's Activity of a Course with the new module LOGICAMENTE.
